        <p>
          In the technology and software development industry, reasoning models offer unparalleled support in generating, refactoring, and planning complex projects. Unlike chat models—which typically produce conversational responses—reasoning models utilize chain-of-thought processes to create complete project plans, generate multi-step code solutions, and even integrate external tools for debugging. These capabilities drive efficiency and significantly reduce error rates.
