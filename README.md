# Building AI Applications: Exploring Agents and Workflows  

## Welcome to the Course!  

In this course, you'll gain a deep understanding of **agents** and **workflows**, two essential paradigms in AI application development. Whether you're building **autonomous AI-driven systems** or designing **structured automation pipelines**, knowing when to use an agent versus a workflow is critical.  

### What Are Agents and Workflows?  

- **Agents**: These are systems that **autonomously make decisions and take actions** based on their environment. They often leverage AI and machine learning to **adapt and respond dynamically** to different scenarios. Agents are ideal for complex, unpredictable tasks that require decision-making and flexibility.  

- **Workflows**: A workflow is a **predefined sequence of tasks** executed in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome. Unlike agents, workflows do not make decisions or adapt to changes autonomously. Instead, they **follow a structured, repeatable process**, making them well-suited for predictable and rule-based automation.  

## What Youâ€™ll Learn  

This course is designed to provide both **theoretical insights** and **practical applications** for building AI-powered solutions. We will explore:  

### 1. **When to Use Agents vs. Workflows**  
   - Understanding **decision-making capabilities** of agents  
   - Recognizing scenarios where workflows are **more efficient and reliable**  
   - Designing hybrid systems that combine **agents and workflows** for optimal performance  

### 2. **Core Building Blocks of AI Applications**  
   - **Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Search (RAG)**: How to enhance AI responses by accessing relevant information dynamically  
   - **Tool Integration**: Connecting AI with external tools, APIs, and databases  
   - **Memory (Short-Term & Long-Term)**: Storing and recalling past interactions for more **context-aware AI applications**  
   - **Structured Outputs**: Ensuring AI systems generate consistent, interpretable responses  

### 3. **Exploring Agent Frameworks**  
   - A deep dive into existing **agent frameworks**  
   - How different frameworks simplify and enhance AI development  
   - Selecting the right framework based on your **use case and technical requirements**  

By the end of this course, you'll have a **clear understanding of agents and workflows**, know **how to build AI-driven systems effectively**, and be **equipped with hands-on knowledge** of the tools and frameworks that make AI development more powerful.
