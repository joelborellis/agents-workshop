# Strategies for Creating Agents and Workflows in AI Software Development

Welcome to this course designed to explore the exciting world of agents and workflows in AI software development. In recent times, the term "Agent" has emerged as the buzzword in our field, marking a significant shift from non-actionable chatbots to intelligent systems capable of performing tasks and taking dynamic actions.

## Course Objectives

- Understand the evolution from traditional chatbots to task-performing AI agents.
- Learn strategies and best practices for creating robust agents.
- Compare and contrast full-agent implementations with LLM-driven workflows.
- Explore core building blocks and common design patterns apparent in Agents and Workflows.
- Review modern frameworks that streamline agent and workflow development.

## Agents vs. Workflows

While the trend is moving toward agent-based software that actively performs tasks, there are scenarios where a full agent implementation may be more than necessary. For predefined sets of actions or tasks, using a simple yet effective workflow powered by large language models (LLMs) can be the optimal approach.

## Core Building Blocks

This course delves into essential techniques that form the foundation of both agents and workflows, including:

- **Document Retrieval:** Efficient techniques for accessing and utilizing relevant documents.
- **Tool Usage (Functions):** Integrating external functions and APIs to extend system capabilities.
- **Memory Management:** Leveraging short-term and long-term memory to keep context and history.
- **Structured Outputs:** Generating organized and predictable responses that adhere to defined formats.

These capabilities are integral to most modern LLMs, allowing them to be augmented for enhanced functionality in agent development.

## Common Design Patterns

Developers have identified several patterns that facilitate predictable and effective outcomes. By following these patterns, you can ensure a smoother development process. Some of the key patterns discussed in this course include:

- **Prompt Chaining:** Connecting multiple prompts to handle complex tasks.
- **Routing:** Directing queries or tasks to the most suitable process or sub-agent.
- **Parallelization:** Running multiple operations concurrently to enhance performance.
- **Orchestration:** Coordinating various tasks or agents to work together seamlessly.
- **Evaluator-Optimizer:** Iteratively refining outputs to improve performance and accuracy.

These patterns are not only central to agents but are also integrated within modern agent frameworks such as Autogen, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, and LangGraph.

## Agent Frameworks

To enhance productivity in AI development, several frameworks have emerged that simplify the creation and management of agents and workflows. In this course, we will:

- Explore various popular frameworks.
- Highlight areas where these frameworks offer incremental efficiency gains.
- Discuss how each framework implements the aforementioned core techniques and design patterns.

By understanding these frameworks, you will be better equipped to decide which approach—agent or workflow—is most suitable for your project needs.
