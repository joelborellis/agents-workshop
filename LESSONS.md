# Workshop Outline: Building Effective Agents with LLMs

This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the key patterns and workflows behind building effective agentic systems. Through a series of lessons, participants will learn the fundamentals of augmented LLMs, explore various workflow patterns, and understand how to design autonomous agents. Each lesson builds on the previous ones, combines theoretical concepts with practical Python coding examples, and highlights best practices and real-world use cases.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Agentic Systems and Workflows

**Learning Objectives:**  
Participants will understand the basic definitions and differences between agents and workflows, and why simple, composable patterns often outperform over-engineered solutions. They will learn the trade-offs between using single-step LLM calls and building multi-turn, dynamic systems.

**Topics Covered:**
- Definition of agentic systems versus traditional workflows  
- Trade-offs (latency, cost, accuracy) when choosing an approach  
- When to choose simple prompt engineering vs. building an autonomous agent

## Lesson 2: The Expanded LLM – Building Block of Agentic Systems

**Learning Objectives:**  
This lesson introduces the expanded LLM.  You will explore how to enhance an LLM with retrieval, tool integration, and memory (short and long term), and understand how these expansions of the LLM's core capabilities support dynamic information processing and enhanced responses from the LLM.

**Topics Covered:**
- Retrieval  
- Tools (function calling)
- Memory - short term and long term

## Lesson 3: Exploring Workflow Patterns for LLM Systems

### Lesson 3.1: Prompt Chaining

**Learning Objectives:**  
Participants will learn to decompose complex tasks into sequential LLM calls where each call’s output becomes the next call’s input. They will understand the benefit of intermediary “gate” checks for accuracy.

**Topics Covered:**
- Breaking tasks into fixed subtasks  
- Incorporating validation or "gate" conditions in the workflow

**Python Coding Example:**  
A simple chain of prompts with a gate check:
```python
def prompt_chain_step(input_text):
    # Simulate processing with an LLM call
    return input_text + " -> processed"

def prompt_chain_workflow(initial_input):
    # Step 1: Process input
    intermediate = prompt_chain_step(initial_input)
    # Gate: Check if intermediate result meets a condition (e.g., length check)
    if len(intermediate) < 30:
        return "Intermediate result insufficient, process halted."
    # Step 2: Continue processing
    final_output = prompt_chain_step(intermediate)
    return final_output

print(prompt_chain_workflow("Initial prompt"))
```

### Lesson 3.2: Routing Workflows

**Learning Objectives:**  
Learners will explore how to classify inputs and direct them to specialized processing paths, ensuring that different task types are handled optimally.

**Topics Covered:**
- Input classification and decision-making within workflows  
- Separation of concerns for handling varied task types

**Python Coding Example:**  
A basic routing example where input is classified to different functions:
```python
def category_a_processor(input_text):
    return f"Category A processed: {input_text}"

def category_b_processor(input_text):
    return f"Category B processed: {input_text}"

def route_input(input_text):
    # Simple classification logic based on keywords
    if "urgent" in input_text:
        return category_a_processor(input_text)
    else:
        return category_b_processor(input_text)

print(route_input("urgent: please check the system"))
```

### Lesson 3.3: Parallelization: Sectioning and Voting

**Learning Objectives:**  
Students will understand how to run multiple LLM calls concurrently either by dividing a task into independent subtasks (sectioning) or replicating task execution for diverse outputs (voting), and learn how to aggregate results.

**Topics Covered:**
- Benefits of concurrent LLM execution  
- Techniques for task sectioning versus multiple attempts for consensus

**Python Coding Example (Using Threading):**  
A simplified parallelization example using Python’s threading to simulate parallel LLM calls.
```python
import threading

def worker(task, results, index):
    # Simulated LLM call for a specific subtask
    results[index] = f"Result from {task}"

def parallel_worker(tasks):
    threads = []
    results = [None] * len(tasks)
    for index, task in enumerate(tasks):
        t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(task, results, index))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    return results

tasks = ["subtask1", "subtask2", "subtask3"]
print("Parallel results:", parallel_worker(tasks))
```

### Lesson 3.4: Orchestrator-Workers Pattern

**Learning Objectives:**  
Participants will study how a central orchestrator LLM can dynamically break down a complex task, delegate these tasks to worker functions, and synthesize their outputs into a cohesive final result.

**Topics Covered:**
- Role of the orchestrator in managing workflow  
- Delegation and synthesis of worker outputs

**Python Coding Example:**  
An example orchestrator function dispatching tasks to simulated worker functions:
```python
def orchestrator(task):
    # Simulate breaking the task into subtasks
    subtasks = [f"{task} part {i}" for i in range(1, 4)]
    worker_results = [worker_simulation(sub) for sub in subtasks]
    # Synthesize results
    return " | ".join(worker_results)

def worker_simulation(subtask):
    # Simulated worker processing a subtask
    return f"[Processed {subtask}]"

print("Orchestrated task result:", orchestrator("Complex Task"))
```

### Lesson 3.5: Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow

**Learning Objectives:**  
This lesson focuses on iterative refinement processes where one LLM generates solutions and another evaluates the result, providing feedback to guide further iterations.

**Topics Covered:**
- Iterative improvement cycles using evaluation feedback  
- Benefits of a looped workflow in achieving optimal results

**Python Coding Example:**  
A simple loop simulating iterative refinement:
```python
def generate_solution(input_text):
    return input_text + " - solution draft"

def evaluate_solution(solution):
    # Simulate an evaluation that accepts when a criterion is met
    if len(solution) > 40:
        return True
    return False

def evaluator_optimizer(input_text, max_iterations=5):
    solution = generate_solution(input_text)
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        if evaluate_solution(solution):
            return f"Accepted: {solution}"
        else:
            # Provide feedback and refine
            solution = generate_solution(solution)  # In practice, refine based on evaluator feedback
    return "Could not optimize solution within iterations."

print(evaluator_optimizer("Start task."))
```

## Lesson 4: Designing Autonomous Agents

**Learning Objectives:**  
This lesson distinguishes autonomous agents from basic workflows. Participants will learn how to design systems where the LLM dynamically selects actions, loops until a goal is reached, and interacts with humans or an environment for feedback.

**Topics Covered:**
- Characteristics of autonomous agents versus fixed workflows  
- When to use agents for open-ended, iterative tasks  
- Key design principles: simplicity, transparency, and well-crafted tool interfaces

**Python Coding Example:**  
A basic loop simulating an autonomous agent interacting with an environment:
```python
def autonomous_agent(task):
    iterations = 0
    current_state = task
    while iterations < 5:
        # Simulate decision-making and tool usage
        current_state += f" -> step{iterations}"
        print(f"Agent iteration {iterations}: {current_state}")
        # Simulate a feedback check (stop if condition met)
        if "step3" in current_state:
            return f"Task completed: {current_state}"
        iterations += 1
    return f"Max iterations reached: {current_state}"

print(autonomous_agent("Initial Task"))
```

## Lesson 5: Frameworks vs. Building from Scratch

**Learning Objectives:**  
Participants will analyze the benefits and trade-offs of using established frameworks (such as LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock) compared to building custom agentic solutions directly with LLM APIs.

**Topics Covered:**
- Overview of popular agent frameworks and their abstractions  
- Risks of over-abstraction and the importance of understanding underlying code  
- When to leverage frameworks for rapid prototyping and when to reduce layers for production

**Python Discussion Example:**
